# RPorto-Portfolio

Explanation of Technologies Used:

I used CSS Flexbox to organize where elements are placed.
- If the size of the webpage is reduced, the elements on the page will be reoriented for mobile users.

I also used Jquery to create 3 points of interaction for the user.
- On the Biography webpage, Users can click a button to show or hide text relating to certain periods in my life.
- On the Projects webpage, Users can click a button to open a modal window that will contain more detail about a project.
- In the aside section of my webpages, Users can click buttons to cycle through various pictures.

Approach Taken:
- I wanted to have my webpages look neat and organized, so I structured the webpages to look uniform and static. I'm also not very good at making pretty looking websites so I focused on the functionality first before changing colors and using pictures.

Unsolved Problems:
- The text on my webpages don't scale with the window size so it feels like there is a bunch of empty space when the webpage is expanded to full-screen.
